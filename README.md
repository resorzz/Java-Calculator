# Java Calculator 🧮

![Calculator Preview](https://github.com/resorzz/Java-Calculator/blob/main/src/icon/icon.png)

Welcome to my Java Calculator project! This modern calculator application was developed as part of my first-year DAM (Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma) studies and was inspired by Bro Code's Java calculator tutorial.

## ✨ Project Description

This is a basic calculator application built with Java Swing, featuring a modern dark theme with purple accents, sound effects, and an operation history system. 

## 🚀 Features

### Core Operations
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Advanced Functions**: Sign toggle (±), decimal point support
- **Error Handling**: Smart division by zero detection with audio feedback

### User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with purple gradient design and rounded buttons
- **Sound System**: Different sound effects for buttons, operations, and errors
- **Operation History**: Stores up to 300 previous calculations with clickable results
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and button animations
- **Expression Display**: Shows current operation in real-time

### Technical Highlights
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across multiple classes
- **Memory Management**: Efficient audio resource handling with automatic cleanup
- **Input Validation**: Robust error checking and user input validation
- **Responsive Design**: Calculator layout with intuitive button placement

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Swing
- **Audio**: javax.sound.sampled
- **Architecture**: MVC Pattern

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java compatible IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/resorzz/Java-Calculator.git
cd Java-Calculator


2. **Open in your IDE**
- Import the project into your preferred Java IDE
- Ensure all source files are in the `src` directory

3. **Run the application**
- Execute `Principal.java` as the main class
- Or compile and run from command line:
javac src/*.java
java -cp src Principal


## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Basic Operations**: Click number buttons and operators (+, -, ×, ÷)
2. **Calculate**: Press the equals button (=) to get results
3. **History**: Click any previous calculation in the history panel to reuse its result. History retains the past 300 operations, if you click in the result of them, it will move to the main display.
4. **Clear**: Use 'C' to clear everything or 'Del' to delete the last character
5. **Sign Toggle**: Use '±' to change the sign of the current number

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Sound System
- **Button Sounds**: Audible feedback for all button presses
- **Operation Sounds**: Special sound for successful calculations
- **Error Alerts**: Distinct audio warning for mathematical errors

### History Management
- Automatically saves all calculations
- Displays in reverse chronological order
- Click any result to continue calculating with that number
- Clear history option available

### Error Handling
- Division by zero protection
- Invalid input detection
- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
